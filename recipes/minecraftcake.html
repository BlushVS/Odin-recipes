    <h3 class="cakesection">Chocolate Cake</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="cakesection">Decorations</h3>

<ul>
    <li>¼ cup cherry jam</li>
    <li>3 cups chocolate buttercream frosting</li>
    <li>14 ounces marzipan</li>
    <li>5 drops red food coloring, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2 class="smalltitle"><u>Instructions</u></h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch square cake pans.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Sift 2 1/3 cups plus 1 1/2 tablespoon flour, 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Beat butter and white sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. Add flour mixture alternately with 1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoon milk, mixing batter gently between each addition.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Trim tops of cake layers to make sure they are flat. Set 1 layer on a serving platter. Spread jam on top; cover with second layer. Spread chocolate buttercream frosting over top and sides of the cake, reserving about 2 tablespoons frosting.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Pinch off a piece of marzipan the size of a golf ball. Add red food coloring and knead until color is evenly distributed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Dust a flat work surface with confectioners' sugar and roll out remaining, undyed, marzipan. Cut out a 9-inch square; carefully transfer to the top of the cake.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Roll trimmings of marzipan and cut into four 9x1-1/2-inch strips. Cut 3 rectangular notches into 1 edge of each strip. Press strips onto the sides of the cake, notches facing down; gently press top and strips of marzipan together to adhere.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Roll out red marzipan and cut into squares of varying sizes. Spread a little of the reserved frosting on the back of each square to act as a glue; arrange in a random Minecraft pattern on top of the cake.</li>
</ol>
